# ML-Workflow-Image-Classification
Built and composed scalable, ML-enabled, AWS application. Used AWS Sagemaker to build an image classification model that can tell bicycles apart from motorcycles. Deployed model, used AWS Lambda functions to build supporting services, and AWS Step Functions to compose model and services into an event-driven application.
